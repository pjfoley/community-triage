# 2015-02-26

(The format for this week is not the usual format due to lack of note taking.)

Mostly reviewed nodejs, with some postgresql/stdlib/gcc/java/rabbitmq thrown in for good measure. Towards the end, we talked about nibalizer's puppet-community-ci bot that he is working on (http://planck.nibalizer.com/buildlogs/).
