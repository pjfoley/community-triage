## postgresql 580

Missing docs, should at least have a docstring.

## postgresql 579

Merged.

## postgresql 575

* This should be a major version bump since we're removing a depedency
* This module does have an explicit need for the apt module

Rejected.

## postgresql 571

Still needs docs and tests.

## postgresql 569

Needs some style-guide fixage. Spacing around equal signs and hash rocket alignment.

## postgresql 564

The `validate_string` on L78 needs to be `validate_re`. Was broken in the original and we should fix that up in a separate pull request.

Merged.

## postgresql 560

Needs to be rethought. Parameters that are being used for interpolation can be undef which gives rather weird results.

## postgresql 550

* Variable needs to be renamed
* Needs a rebase
* `local_auth_options` being undeath can be a problem

## postgresql 547

Closed due to inactivity.

## postgresql 546

Hunter will squash and merge.

## postgresql 545

Closed as invalid. The implementation ends up changing the error message but doesn't achieve anything more than that.

## postgresql 543

Closed.

## postgresql 536

Closed. This use case can already be accomplished.

## postgresql 530

Accepted. Hunter will rebase and merge.
