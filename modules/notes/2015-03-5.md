## stdlib 421

* Making JSON by hand is a bad idea
* Rework it to check if the hash repsonds to `to_json` instead

## stdlib 416

* Respond with how to do this with `has_key` instead
* This is not needed, close it

## stdlib 409

* This will only be reliable in masterless mode
* Closed

## stdlib 408

* This needs to be run through all the acceptance CI
* Why are we only salting on the JVM?
* Still a function masking the password variable

## stdlib 405

* We're still not liking base64
* It's not usable as POSIX password salt as per the contributor's own argument

Hunter comments about how we'd like to see this done instead.

## stdlib 404

Asked for a rebase.

## stdlib 390

## stdlib 378

Closed due to inactivity.

## stdlib 375

This is good. Merged.

## stdlib 369

This is good. Merged.

## stdlib 332

This only returns floats on Ruby >2.0. It's `fqdn_rand` but with a minimum. Documentation is completely wrong. Closed.

## stdlib 307

This is a 'deterministic' random function. Closed.

## stdlib 305

Don't use hashes for passwords that you don't know what they are. Has been stale since August. No one likes this. No tests. Closed.
