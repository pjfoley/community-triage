### Puppet
##### To Discuss
* PUP-4363
  - PR #3780
  - We should get eric0's opinion on if we want to bring this in
* PUP-1072 (50:00)
  - PR #3748
  - Blocked on PR #3741
  - **Action: Branan/Melissa to review**
* PUP-4080 (37:00)
  - PR #3675
  - Impacts PR #3372
  - This is not functionality we explicitely want to pull into core. It does expose limitations that should be addressed in core, but the main functionality this deals with should be in a module.
  - This should be closed while we come up with a better solution
  - PUP-4368 abstracting file termini, allow loading from modules to allow this functionality
  - We should reach out to senior dev to verify this course of action
  - **Action: Branan to follow up**
* PUP-3127 (30:00)
  - PR #3632
  - Has proved very difficult to test because LDAP is challenging
  - **Action: Zach to test, sync up with Geoffrey**
  - Zach should sync up with Geoffrey to follow up on this testing. Geoffrey already has a lot of this set up, but is running into issues on the puppet side
* PUP-3094 (55:00)
  - Not a lot of agreement, more resolution required before any code is merged
  - [puppet-dev thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/puppet-dev/VTb2o-Nuxkw)
  - Based on discussion in the thread, this PR should be closed. This PR is not the route we want to take to solve this issue.
  - Closed while we decide on the better path forward, resolution to questions brought up in the thread
* PUP-3332 (10:00)
  - PR #3113
  - Breaking change, if this does get in, it can't be until Puppet 5
  - Solving the `insync?` case, but not the other cases where we have lifecycle methods that depend on doing conversions
  - Requires more thought on the type and provider interfaces and how they should be defined
  - Close ticket with these two concerns
  - Create an epic with types/providers interface questions and clarifications
  - **Action: Kylo to create epic**
  - **Action: Branan to close ticket listing concerns**
