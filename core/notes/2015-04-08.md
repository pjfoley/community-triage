### Puppet
##### To Discuss
* [PUP-1931](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1931) (39:00)
  - [PR #3789](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3789)
  - **Action: Branan to test passing in an empty string**
  - **Action: Melissa to add empty string case to spec tests**
  - We should double check this behavior change with folks in CS to make sure we're not going to break everything for people
* [PUP-1072](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-1072) (11:00)
  - [PR #3748](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3748)
  - Blocked on [PR #3741](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3741)
  - **Action: Branan/Melissa to review**
  - Potentially impacted by [PUP-4368](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4368), extending the file type to allow this work to be modular
  - We should get eric0's opinion on this, if it is something that should be pulled in. Need to check if he's already given the okay or not.
  - Similar to [PR #3675](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3675) in that this might actually need to go into a module, not into core
  - Maybe merge this in, and then add it to the list of things to be split out when we go modular.
  - Ping Chris, Kylo, Eric0, decide on concrete next steps.
* [PR #3741](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3741) (36:00)
  - [PR #3748](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3748) is dependent on this
  - Blocked until we decide what we are going to do with [PR #3748](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3748)
* [PUP-4230](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4230) (35:00)
  - [PR #3735](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3735)
  - **Action: Josh/Michael to review**
* [PUP-4131](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4131) (45:00)
  - [PR #3694](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3694)
  - waiting on contributor to add tests
  - We should give some guidance on adding tests
  - May need to retarget this at the puppet/stable branch
  - **Action: Branan to look into adding tests**
* [PUP-4080](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4080) (22:00)
  - [PR #3675](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3675)
  - Impacts [PR #3372](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3372)
  - This is not functionality we explicitly want to pull into core. It does expose limitations that should be addressed in core, but the main functionality this deals with should be in a module.
  - This should be closed while we come up with a better solution
  - [PUP-4368](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4368) abstracting file termini, allow loading from modules to allow this functionality
  - We should reach out to senior dev to verify this course of action
  - **Action: Kylo to review tickets**
  - To be closed out, and the ticket should remain open. This PR is not how we want to solve this problem.
* [PUP-4030](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PUP-4030) (31:00)
  - [PR #3652](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3652)
  - Ready for review
  - **Action: Branan to look into adding test coverage**

  - [PR #3632](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3632)
  - Has proved very difficult to test because LDAP is challenging
  - **Action: Zach/Geoffrey to test**
  - Zach should sync up with Geoffrey to follow up on this testing. Geoffrey already has a lot of this set up, but is running into issues on the puppet side
